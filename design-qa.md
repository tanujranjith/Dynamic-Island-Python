- Source pixels:
  - Detached privacy screenshot: 742 × 681
  - First-fix privacy screenshot: 516 × 169
  - Confirmed compact-dot screenshot: 364 × 165
  - Stacked accessory-row screenshot: 962 × 209
  - Expanded floating-dot screenshot: 1276 × 490
  - Clipped countdown screenshot: 905 × 265
- Latest implementation screenshot: unavailable after the current rebuild
- Implementation viewport: native transparent WPF window with a 1200-DIP canvas
- Density normalization: not possible until a post-fix native capture is available
- Target state: expanded Apple-style island with camera active

## Intended visual behavior

- Compact mode shows only the 8-DIP green/orange recording light inside its 18-DIP trailing orb.
- Expanded mode replaces the outside orb with a 26-DIP inline Live Activity beneath the top-right controls.
- The expanded activity contains the semantic sensor dot, the live sensor state, and a short `LIVE` marker.
- Sensor activation while expanded uses a 260 ms scale/slide and 180 ms fade.
- AirPods and live widgets remain distinct cards in one 64-DIP horizontal accessory lane.
- The live-widget rail sizes from visible cards up to 332 DIP, fitting weather and countdown together while preserving AirPods space.
- A third widget and beyond can be reached with horizontal mouse-wheel scrolling.

The layout follows Apple's guidance to preserve information between compact and expanded presentations, keep content snug, avoid notification-style layouts, and animate existing live information into its new position.

## Comparison history

### Pass 1 — detached privacy notification

- [P1] Privacy notification was detached in the middle of the desktop.
  - Fix: removed privacy from the generic banner.

### Pass 2 — attached text card

- [P1] The attached privacy disclosure still read as a large notification.
  - Evidence: `privacy-text-card-after-first-fix.png`.
  - Fix: removed the disclosure and reduced compact privacy to a trailing recording orb.

### Pass 3 — compact dot

- User evidence: `privacy-dot-compact-confirmed.png` confirms the compact dot-only treatment.
- [P1] The orb initially disappeared in expanded mode.
  - Fix: kept sensor activity visible while moving the orb to the expanded shell edge.

### Pass 4 — accessory-row density

- [P1] AirPods and weather occupied two stacked full-width rows.
  - Evidence: `airpods-widgets-stacked-before-row-fix.png`.
  - Fix: combined them into one row as separate cards and reduced height reservation to one lane.

### Pass 5 — expanded state confirmation

- User evidence: `expanded-floating-privacy-dot-before-live-activity.png`.
- AirPods and weather are visibly separate, aligned on one row, and not clipped.
- [P1] The privacy orb remained detached from the expanded content and did not read as a Live Activity.
  - Fix: made the outside orb compact-only and added a snug inline activity beneath the expanded controls.

### Pass 6 — current implementation

- Release build: succeeded with zero warnings and zero errors.
- Automated tests: 97 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- Root app: republished and relaunched successfully as process 16712.
- Post-fix visual evidence: pending a same-state expanded screenshot.

### Pass 7 — countdown overflow

- [P1] The fixed 230-DIP widget viewport showed weather but clipped the countdown card at the island edge.
  - Evidence: `countdown-widget-clipped-before-dynamic-rail.png`.
  - Fix: replaced the fixed width with a content-derived rail capped at 332 DIP, reduced weather to 180 DIP and countdown to 136 DIP, and added horizontal mouse-wheel navigation for additional widgets.
- Release build: succeeded with zero warnings and zero errors.
- Automated tests: 97 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- Root app: republished and relaunched successfully as process 20344.
- Post-fix visual evidence: pending a weather-plus-countdown screenshot.

## Required fidelity surfaces

- Fonts and typography: the inline activity uses the existing Segoe UI Variable hierarchy at 10.5 and 8 DIP with semibold/bold optical contrast; post-fix capture is pending.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the activity fits the existing fixed 64-DIP header region and does not add shell height; its final alignment requires capture.
- Colors and visual tokens: the opaque dark activity surface, subtle keyline, Apple green camera state, and Apple orange microphone state follow existing tokens.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: no new imagery was required; the confirmed AirPods raster remains sharp and uniformly scaled.
- Copy and content: compact privacy is text-free; expanded privacy exposes only the sensor state and `LIVE`, without inventing an app identity.

## Findings

- [P1] The rebuilt inline Live Activity has not been captured.
  - Location: expanded Apple-style header beneath the top-right controls.
  - Evidence: the pre-fix screenshot shows the detached orb, while the new build and process evidence do not show the revised pixels.
  - Impact: final pill width, truncation, control clearance, and motion endpoint cannot yet be visually certified.
  - Fix: capture the expanded camera-active state and compare it directly with the pre-fix expanded screenshot.
- [P1] The rebuilt dynamic widget rail has not been captured.
  - Location: expanded AirPods and live-widget accessory lane.
  - Evidence: the source screenshot shows countdown clipped after weather; code, build, test, and process evidence confirm the fix is running but do not show its pixels.
  - Impact: final AirPods truncation and full countdown visibility cannot yet be visually certified.
  - Fix: capture the expanded state with AirPods, weather, and countdown visible.

## Implementation checklist

- Capture the expanded camera-active state.
- Confirm the outside orb is absent.
- Confirm the inline activity is snug, legible, and clear of the controls and progress bar.
- Capture AirPods, weather, and countdown together and confirm all three cards remain legible.

final result: blocked
